# Expense-Tracker
An Expense Tracker webapp built in Javascript, CSS, and HTML

### Screenshots of how the web-app works is on the screenshots branch.

## Future implementations:
- Adding animations to the css file
- Giving the user access to add a custom background(colour or image)
- Linking the Transaction History to a .csv file
- Creating a 'receipts' section which accepts images or pdfs as receipts for transactions.
- Calculates average spending over periods of time(Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Anuually)

(I'll try and implement these, but feel free to try them yourselves)
